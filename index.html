            <h1 id="h6">Why Amcha Ghar </h1> 
            <p>Every child deserves to have a childhood filled with happy memories. <br> Amcha Ghar is a non-profit organization that understands the <br> adversities faced by many young girls. We have worked together and <br> have devised solutions to aid them in the best possible way. Since <br> 1996, we have been involved in their holistic development. Over <br> 100’s of orphan girls have been provided with the much needed care,<br> love and support at our orphanage. We empower the orphanage <br> children by working closely with various institutes. We are helping <br> orphans by providing them with good food, quality education, psycho <br>-social support, monthly health check-up and treatment if any, sports <br>/ recreational and extra-curricular interventions for their inclusive  <br>growth at the girls orphanage. <br>

 

                We have a long way to go in creating a safe haven for young  <br>children. Helping orphans lead a merrier life is what we aim for. With  <br>your kindness and donation, these young children will definitely find <br> their path to a fulfilling life. While there are many orphanages in India <br> aiding these beautiful kids, many still need to be cared for. We hope a <br> day comes where every child is looked after, because every kid  <br>deserves to live a more dignified life filled with happy moments.
